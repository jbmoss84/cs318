    <h1>Polynomials</h1>
    <p>If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:
    <dl>
    <dt>Constant</dt> 
    <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a.</dd>
    <dt>Linear</dt> 
    <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a &times; x &plus; b.</dd>
    <dt>Quadratic</dt>
    <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a &times; x<sup>2</sup> + b &times; x &plus; c.</dd>
    <dt>Cubic</dt>
    <dd>
    Constant polynomials have the form a  &times; x<sup>3</sup> + b &times; x<sup>2</sup> &plus; c &times; x &plus; d.
