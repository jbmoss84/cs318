<h3>How does Google protect my privacy and keep my information secure?</h3>
<p class="answer">We know security and privacy are important to you – and they are important to us, too. We make it a priority to provide strong security and give you confidence that your information is safe and accessible when you need it.</p>
<h3>How can I remove information about myself from Google's search results?</h3>
<p class="answer">Google search results are a reflection of the content publicly available on the web. Search engines can’t remove content directly from websites, so removing search results from Google wouldn’t remove the content from the web. If you want to remove something from the web, you should contact the webmaster of the site the content is posted on and ask him or her to make a change. </p>
<h3>Are my search queries sent to websites when I click on Google Search results?</h3>
<p class="answer">In some cases, yes. When you click on a search result in Google Search, your web browser also may send the Internet address, or URL, of the search results page to the destination webpage as the HTTP Referrer. The URL of the search results page may sometimes contain the search query you entered.</p>
